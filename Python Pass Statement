What is pass statement in Python?
In Python programming, the pass statement is a null statement. The difference between a comment and a pass statement in Python is that while the interpreter ignores a comment entirely, pass is not ignored.

However, nothing happens when the pass is executed. It results in no operation (NOP).

Syntax of pass
pass
We generally use it as a placeholder.

Suppose we have a loop or a function that is not implemented yet, but we want to implement it in the future. They cannot have an empty body. The interpreter would give an error. So, we use the pass statement to construct a body that does nothing.

Example: pass Statement
'''pass is just a placeholder for
functionality to be added later.'''
sequence = {'p', 'a', 's', 's'}
for val in sequence:
    pass
We can do the same thing in an empty function or class as well.

def function(args):
    pass
class Example:
    pass
